Q2 CMD pipe2

Pipes are useful in all sorts of situations. For example, what does this command do:

cat file.txt | grep "name_here" | tee file2.txt | wc -l

Always remember that every linux command is thoroughly documented. If you don't know what a command does, just look it up.

Counts the number of times "name_here" appears in file.txt and writes this number in file2.txt
Outputs the number of lines in file.txt that contain "name_here" and also writes the lines to file2.txt
Command fails
